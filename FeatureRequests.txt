Add roles for players when they start playing a game
    Playing game CS:GO, auto create role with name of game
    Auto-add all people that start playing a game to the same role. That way they can mention the people. (makes sense for people that don't have all notifications turned on, only notifications for specific roles)
    Add a bot command "config" so that the server users (moderators?) can enable/disable this functionality (disabled by default)

Have a voice channel that creates other voice channels
    If you're playing a game, create a voice channel that is associated with this gaming instance. See video on iZac Pro in Downloads from the users of Winnie
    After all people have left the voice channel, remove it.
